# **Network ACL Overview**
Here’s a professional step-by-step summary for your notes on Network ACLs (NACLs) in AWS, comparing them to Security Groups (SGs):


1. **Subnet-Level Application**:
   - Network ACLs (NACLs) are applied at the subnet level, affecting all instances within the subnet. Traffic is first inspected by the NACL before reaching the EC2 instance.
   - The traffic is then authorized through the associated security group.

2. **Rules**:
   - NACLs can have both **allow** and **deny** rules.
   - **Security Groups**, in contrast, only support **allow** rules.
   - Rules in NACLs are **numbered**, and traffic is evaluated in the sequence of these rule numbers, from smallest to largest. Best practice is to use increments like 100, 200, 300 for easier management.

3. **Stateless Traffic**:
   - NACLs are stateless, meaning return traffic must be explicitly allowed in outbound rules. For example, allowing inbound traffic does not automatically allow the return traffic.
   - Security Groups are **stateful**, automatically allowing return traffic.

4. **Default NACL**:
   - When creating a subnet, AWS automatically associates a default NACL, which allows all inbound and outbound traffic. Therefore, in default VPC setups, manual configuration of NACLs is often not necessary.

5. **Deny Rules**:
   - NACLs allow you to explicitly **deny** traffic from specific IP addresses, which is not possible with Security Groups.
   - Example: You can deny traffic from an IP (e.g., a bot or malicious source) to the subnet level using a deny rule.

6. **Default NACL Rules**:
   - By default, a **deny all** rule is at the end of both inbound and outbound rules, which cannot be removed.
   - This acts as a fallback rule for traffic that doesn’t match any of the prior rules.

### **Network Traffic Flow Example**
1. **Inbound Traffic**:
   - When traffic is initiated from an IP address (e.g., 1.2.3.4), the inbound NACL checks the rules.
   - If the inbound rule allows the traffic (e.g., TCP on port 80 from 1.2.3.4), the traffic reaches the EC2 instance.
   - Return traffic needs explicit permission via an outbound rule (e.g., from EC2 back to 1.2.3.4).

2. **Outbound Traffic**:
   - If the EC2 instance initiates traffic (e.g., downloading data), the outbound rules are checked.
   - If return traffic is expected, the corresponding **ephemeral port range** must be allowed in the outbound rule.
   - Ephemeral ports are random ports used by the client for outgoing connections and vary per connection.

3. **Denying Specific Traffic**:
   - You can explicitly deny traffic from a specific IP address by adding a deny rule.
   - Example: A source IP (e.g., 9.10.11.12) trying to reach the EC2 instance will be blocked by the deny rule.

### **Key Differences Between Security Groups and Network ACLs**
1. **Scope**:
   - **Security Group**: Works at the EC2 instance (or ENI) level.
   - **NACL**: Works at the subnet level, affecting all instances in the subnet.

2. **Rules**:
   - **Security Group**: Only allow rules (no explicit deny).
   - **NACL**: Supports both allow and deny rules.

3. **Statefulness**:
   - **Security Group**: Stateful, automatically allowing return traffic.
   - **NACL**: Stateless, requires explicit outbound rules for return traffic.

4. **Evaluation Order**:
   - **Security Group**: All rules are evaluated before a decision is made.
   - **NACL**: Rules are evaluated in order, and the first matching rule is applied, stopping further evaluations.

5. **Default Rules**:
   - Both have default rules for handling traffic, but the default NACL denies all traffic unless otherwise allowed.

### **Practical Example for AWS Console**
1. **View NACL in AWS Console**:
   - Navigate to **VPC** in the AWS console.
   - Select a VPC, then go to **Subnets** to view associated network ACLs.
   - Under the **Network ACL** tab, you’ll see default inbound and outbound rules that allow traffic unless manually configured.

This should give you a clear understanding of **Network ACLs** in AWS, their role in securing traffic, and how they compare to **Security Groups**.

# **AWS VPC: Types of IP Addresses**

AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) supports two IP schemes: **IPv4** and **IPv6**. This document details the types of IP addresses in AWS VPC and their key characteristics.

### **1. IPv4 Address Types**
AWS VPC supports three types of IPv4 addresses:

#### **1.1. Private IP Address**
- **Definition**: Private IP addresses are allocated from the subnet CIDR range.
- **Allocation**:
  - Assigned to an EC2 instance when it is launched.
  - The Elastic Network Interface (ENI), which is associated with the EC2 instance, holds the private IP address.
  - If no private IP is specified during launch, AWS allocates one automatically using DHCP.
- **Key Points**:
  - Private IP remains associated with the EC2 instance for its lifetime.
  - Cannot directly communicate with the internet.
  - Example CIDR: `10.10.0.0/24` provides 256 IPs, of which the first 4 and the last IP are reserved, leaving 251 usable IPs.

#### **1.2. Public IP Address**
- **Definition**: Public IP addresses are allocated from AWS's pool of public IP addresses.
- **Allocation**:
  - Public IP is automatically assigned if the instance is launched in a public subnet (a subnet with a route to an Internet Gateway).
  - Public IP changes when an instance is stopped and restarted.
- **Key Points**:
  - Enables internet communication.
  - Released back to AWS's pool upon stopping the instance.
  - Public IP is not static and can cause connectivity issues for clients if the instance is restarted.

#### **1.3. Elastic IP Address (EIP)**
- **Definition**: Elastic IP is a static, public IPv4 address allocated to your AWS account.
- **Allocation**:
  - Remains associated with the account until explicitly released.
  - Can be manually associated with or disassociated from an instance.
- **Key Points**:
  - Ideal for scenarios where a consistent public IP is required.
  - Can be remapped to another EC2 instance if the current instance fails.
  - Prevents disruptions to client connections due to IP address changes.

**Comparison of IPv4 Address Types:**
| Address Type   | Persistence                         | Use Case                            | Scope     |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------|
| Private IP     | Lifetime of the instance           | Internal communication within VPC  | Private   |
| Public IP      | Released upon stop/start           | Temporary internet access           | Public    |
| Elastic IP     | Static, remains until released     | Consistent public access            | Public    |

### **2. IPv6 Address**
#### **Characteristics**:
- **Format**: IPv6 addresses are 128-bit addresses represented in hexadecimal (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).
- **CIDR Allocation**:
  - VPC: `/56`
  - Subnet: `/64`
- **Global Uniqueness**: All IPv6 addresses are globally unique and public. There is no concept of private IPv6 addresses.

#### **Key Points**:
- **Dual-Stack Mode**: AWS VPC supports both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously for some resources (e.g., load balancers).
- **Static Behavior**:
  - IPv6 addresses remain associated with the instance even after stop/start.
  - IPv6 addresses are released only when the instance is terminated.

**Comparison of IPv4 vs. IPv6:**
| Feature                | IPv4                             | IPv6                                |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Address Length         | 32-bit                          | 128-bit                            |
| Address Format         | Dotted decimal (e.g., `192.0.2.1`) | Hexadecimal (e.g., `2001:db8::1`) |
| Private/Public Distinction | Yes                              | No (all are public)                |
| Address Allocation     | Subnet-specific                  | Globally unique                    |
| Dual Stack Support     | Supported                        | Supported                          |

### **3. Summary**
- **IPv4 Address Types**:
  - **Private IP**: Internal communication within the VPC.
  - **Public IP**: Internet connectivity; released upon stop/start.
  - **Elastic IP**: Static public IP for consistent internet connectivity.
- **IPv6 Addresses**:
  - Globally unique and public.
  - Remain associated with instances like Elastic IPs.

AWS VPC supports dual-stack mode, allowing the use of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for improved scalability and internet communication.

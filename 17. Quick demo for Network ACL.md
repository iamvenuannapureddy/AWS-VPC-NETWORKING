# **Network ACL Demonstration and Impact on Connectivity**

---


In this lecture, we demonstrate how **Network ACLs (NACLs)** work within AWS. The setup involves a **VPC** with a **single public subnet** and a **web server** running in the public subnet. The goal is to experiment with various **NACL rule configurations** to understand how they affect traffic to and from the web server.

---

### **Prerequisites**
- **VPC**: A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with one public subnet.
- **Web Server**: A web server deployed in the public subnet.
- **IP Address**: The public IP address of your local machine, which will be used in the rule configurations.
- **Network ACL**: Default rules already in place, allowing all traffic by default.

---

### **Default NACL Rules**
- **Rule Numbers**: NACLs have rule numbers that range from 1 to 32,000. It is best practice to use multiples of 100 for easy management (e.g., 100, 200, 300).
- **Default Allow Rule**: The default rule (rule number 100) allows all traffic.
- **Default Deny Rule**: At the end of the rule list, a **deny all** rule is present (default rule with a wildcard *).

---

### **Experiment Scenarios**

1. **Removing Default Inbound Rule**:
   - Edit the **Inbound Rule** to remove the default allow rule.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Traffic will be blocked, as there’s no rule allowing inbound traffic.

2. **Removing Default Outbound Rule**:
   - Edit the **Outbound Rule** to remove the default allow rule.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Outbound traffic will be blocked, as there’s no rule allowing outbound connections.

3. **Allowing Outbound Traffic**:
   - Add a new rule to allow outbound traffic on **port 80** (HTTP).
   - **Expected Outcome**: Traffic should not work, as port 80 is not the correct destination port for the source system (your machine). It uses a random ephemeral port instead.

4. **Configuring Ephemeral Port Range for Outbound Traffic**:
   - Modify the **Outbound Rule** to allow traffic on a range of ephemeral ports (e.g., **1024–65535**).
   - **Expected Outcome**: Once the rule is updated, traffic should be allowed.

---

### **Key Concepts**

- **Stateless Nature of NACLs**:
  - NACLs are **stateless**, meaning that return traffic must also be explicitly allowed via outbound rules. In contrast, security groups are **stateful**, automatically allowing return traffic.
  
- **Ephemeral Ports**:
  - Outbound rules must include the correct **ephemeral port range** for return traffic to be allowed.

### **Blocking Specific IP Addresses**

1. **Denying My Own IP Address**:
   - Add an inbound rule to deny traffic from your own public IP address.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The request should be blocked.
   - **Explanation**: Even if the first rule allows all traffic, the deny rule (if placed first) takes precedence because NACL rules are evaluated in order.
  
2. **Changing Rule Order**:
   - Change the order of the rules by placing the **deny rule** first.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The request from your IP address will be denied, as the first matching rule takes effect.

---

### **Important Takeaways**
- **Rule Order Matters**: NACL rules are processed in numerical order, from smallest to largest. The first matching rule is applied, which means later rules are not considered if an earlier rule matches the traffic.
  
- **Outbound Rules and Ephemeral Ports**: When allowing outbound traffic, make sure to cover the correct port ranges (e.g., **1024–65535**) for traffic to flow correctly, especially for client-side requests.

- **Blocking Traffic from an IP**: You can block traffic from specific IP addresses by placing a deny rule in the NACL. If a deny rule comes before a general allow rule, it will take precedence.

### **Conclusion**

This demonstration covered how to configure **Network ACLs** to manage traffic in a VPC, including both inbound and outbound rules. The main points to remember are the **stateless nature of NACLs**, the importance of **rule order**, and the requirement to handle **ephemeral ports** for successful communication.

Feel free to experiment with these rules at the end of the next section when you launch your own web server, and refer to this as your assignment. If you have any questions, reach out for clarification.

## **Creating and Using SSH(Secure SHell) Key Pairs for EC2 Instances**

#### **Overview**
SSH key pairs are essential for securely connecting to EC2 instances in AWS. This guide explains how to create, manage, and use SSH key pairs to connect to EC2 instances, focusing on a Windows environment using PuTTY and PuTTYgen.

#### **Step 1: Understanding SSH Key Pairs**
1. **Key Pair Basics**:  
   - SSH key pairs consist of a **public key** and a **private key**.  
   - **Private Key**: Stored securely on your local machine.  
   - **Public Key**: Stored on the EC2 instance.  

2. **Connection Mechanism**:  
   - When an EC2 instance is launched, the public key is copied to it.  
   - Using the private key, you can securely SSH into the instance via its public IP.  

3. **Regional Nature**:  
   - SSH keys are **regional**. If you work in multiple AWS regions, create separate key pairs for each region.

#### **Step 2: Creating an SSH Key Pair in AWS**
1. Log in to the AWS Console with your **IAM user credentials**.  
2. Navigate to the **EC2 Console** and ensure you are in the desired AWS region (e.g., Mumbai).  
3. In the EC2 dashboard, select **Key Pairs** from the left menu.  
4. Click **Create Key Pair** and configure the following:  
   - **Name**: Use a descriptive name (e.g., "Mumbai").  
   - **File Format**: Choose `.pem` for the private key file.  

5. Download the `.pem` file to your local machine.  
   - This file is your private key. Store it securely, as it is required for SSH access.

#### **Step 3: Preparing SSH Key for Windows (Converting .pem to .ppk)**
1. **Download Required Software**:  
   - Download and install [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) and [PuTTYgen](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/).

2. **Convert .pem to .ppk**:  
   - Open **PuTTYgen**.  
   - Click **Load** and select the downloaded `.pem` file (ensure "All Files" is selected in the file browser).  
   - Once loaded, click **Save Private Key**.  
   - Save the file with a `.ppk` extension in a secure location.  
   - Now you have both `.pem` and `.ppk` files.

#### **Step 4: Launching an EC2 Instance with the Key Pair**
1. Navigate to the **EC2 Console** and click **Launch Instance**.  
2. Select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and instance type.  
3. Under **Key Pair (Login)**, select the key pair created earlier (e.g., "Mumbai").  
4. Configure other settings as needed and launch the instance.  
5. Once the instance is launched, note its **Public IP Address**.

#### **Step 5: Connecting to EC2 Using PuTTY**
1. Open **PuTTY** and configure the connection:  
   - **Host Name**: Enter the public IP of the EC2 instance.  
   - **Port**: Default is 22.  
2. Expand the **Connection** section → SSH → Auth.  
3. Under **Private Key File for Authentication**, browse and select your `.ppk` file.  
4. Go back to the **Session** section and click **Open**.  
5. Accept the security alert if prompted.  
6. Log in using the username `ec2-user` (or the default username for the AMI).  

---

#### **Step 6: Post-Connection Steps**
1. Once connected, you can interact with the EC2 instance via the terminal.  
2. After completing your tasks, if the instance is no longer needed:  
   - Go to the EC2 Console → Select the instance → Click **Terminate**.  

---

#### **Key Notes**
- The `.pem` file is compatible with Linux and macOS SSH clients, while Windows PuTTY requires a `.ppk` file.  
- Keep your private key (`.pem` or `.ppk`) confidential and never share it.  
- The same SSH key pair can be used for multiple EC2 instances in the same region.

By following these steps, you can securely create and use SSH key pairs to manage EC2 instances on AWS.

## AWS Automation for Monitoring EC2 Instances, EBS Volumes, and Elastic IPs

**Overview**:  
This automation is useful for monitoring unused resources in your AWS account, such as EC2 instances, unattached EBS volumes, and unused Elastic IPs, which can lead to unnecessary costs. It helps to get daily email reports summarizing these resources, their cost estimations, and actions you can take.

---

### **Purpose of Automation**:

- **Daily Report**: Receive an email that provides a summary of:
  - Running EC2 instances, regions, and approximate costs.
  - Unattached EBS volumes and potential cost savings by deleting or snapshotting them.
  - Unattached Elastic IPs and associated costs.

- **Cost Awareness**: The email helps keep track of unnecessary costs that can occur if unused resources are left running.

---

### **Components Required**:
1. **AWS Lambda Function**: Triggers EC2 APIs to gather information on resources.
2. **SQS (Simple Queue Service)**: Sends the email.
3. **EventBridge**: Schedules Lambda execution to run at a specified time every day.

### **Steps to Set Up the Automation**:

#### **Step 1: Create the CloudFormation Stack**  
- **Link to Template**: Deploy the automation using a CloudFormation template available via the provided link.
- **Region**: Ensure to select North Virginia (us-east-1) or any relevant AWS region. 
- **Parameter Values**:
  - **AWS Regions**: Specify the AWS regions to scan (e.g., `us-east-1`, `ap-south-1`).
  - **Sender Email**: Email address for notifications (e.g., `aws@yourdomain.com`).
  - **Recipient Email**: List of email addresses to receive the report (comma-separated).
  - **Scheduler Time**: Set the time of day to trigger the report (e.g., 19:00 for 7:00 PM).
  - **SES Region**: If unsure, leave as default (US East 1).

- **Create Stack**: After specifying the parameters, deploy the stack by acknowledging the setup and creating the stack.

---

#### **Step 2: Stack Deployment Confirmation**  
- After a few minutes, verify that the stack has been created successfully in CloudFormation:
  - Lambda function
  - EventBridge schedule
  - SQS integration

---

#### **Step 3: Confirm Email Verification (SES)**  
- **First Trigger**: When Lambda is first triggered, youâ€™ll receive an email from Amazon SES asking for email confirmation. 
- **Confirm Email**: Click the confirmation link in the email to verify the email address and ensure that future emails will be delivered correctly.

---

#### **Step 4: Test Lambda Function Manually**  
- Go to the Lambda service in the AWS Console.
- **Test the Lambda**: Manually trigger the Lambda function by creating a dummy event (you can use `test`).
- **Check Email**: You should receive an email with the resource summary, but if it's the first email, it might land in the spam folder. Mark it as "Not Spam" to ensure proper delivery.

---

#### **Step 5: Review the Report**  
- **Email Content**: The email will include:
  - Number of EC2 instances and estimated cost.
  - Information on unattached EBS volumes and costs.
  - Unused Elastic IPs and their charges.
- **Action**: Based on the report, you can delete unused resources to avoid unnecessary costs. For EBS volumes, consider creating snapshots to reduce costs.

---

### **Tips for Effective Usage**:
- **Frequent Monitoring**: After the first few successful email deliveries, regularly monitor your AWS account for any unused resources.
- **Cost Optimization**: Implement regular checks to optimize your AWS usage and avoid unnecessary charges.
- **Lambda Customization**: If required, you can modify the Lambda function to include more resource types or alter the email format for specific needs.

---

### **Conclusion**:
This automation helps monitor unused AWS resources and their costs, ensuring that you can take action to optimize your AWS environment and avoid unnecessary charges. With the use of CloudFormation, Lambda, SQS, and EventBridge, the setup is simplified and requires minimal ongoing effort.

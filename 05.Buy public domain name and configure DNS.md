**Lecture Notes: Setting Up a Public Domain Name and DNS Configuration**

In this lecture, we will go through the process of setting up a public domain name and configuring DNS, enabling a realistic setup for your labs and projects. While this step is optional, it is highly recommended for a more professional approach.

### **Why Do We Need a Public Domain Name?**
- **Without DNS:** When a user wants to access a web application, they would need to type the public IP address directly. This is not ideal, as it's difficult to remember IP addresses.
  
- **With DNS:** The Domain Name System (DNS) helps by mapping domain names (e.g., `facebook.com`, `google.com`) to corresponding IP addresses. When a user types the domain name into a browser, the DNS server resolves the domain to the correct IP address, allowing the user to access the web application.

- **IP Changes:** If the IP address of the server hosting the web application changes, DNS allows you to update the records, so users are always directed to the new IP address without needing to remember or manually update the address.

### **Steps to Set Up a Public Domain Name and DNS**

#### **Step 1: Purchase a Public Domain Name**
1. **Choose a Domain Name Provider:** Choose a domain name provider (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, or AWS Route 53).
2. **Search and Purchase a Domain Name:** 
   - For example, search for `example.com` or any desired domain. The cost typically ranges from $5 to $20 per year, depending on the provider and the domain.
   - You can purchase the domain name directly from a service like GoDaddy. Once purchased, you will have access to DNS management for that domain.

#### **Step 2: Set Up DNS Management Using AWS Route 53**
1. **Create a Hosted Zone in AWS Route 53:**
   - Log into the AWS Management Console and search for **Route 53**.
   - Go to **Hosted Zones** and create a **Public Hosted Zone** with the same name as your domain (e.g., `example.com`).
   - **Public vs. Private Hosted Zones:**
     - **Public Hosted Zone:** Resolves DNS queries from across the internet.
     - **Private Hosted Zone:** Resolves DNS queries within your VPC (Virtual Private Cloud).
   - Ensure that you create a **Public Hosted Zone** for this setup.

2. **Copy Name Servers from Route 53:**
   - After creating the hosted zone, AWS provides a set of **Name Server (NS)** records.
   - Copy these name servers as they are needed to configure DNS at your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy).

#### **Step 3: Update Name Servers in GoDaddy (or Your Domain Registrar)**
1. **Log into GoDaddy:** Access your GoDaddy portal or the portal of your domain registrar.
2. **Go to Domain Settings:** 
   - Find the domain you purchased and go to its **DNS Management** settings.
3. **Replace Default Name Servers with AWS Name Servers:**
   - In the DNS management section, update the name servers with the AWS Route 53 name servers that you copied earlier.
   - Ensure there are no extra dots at the end of the names when entering them.

4. **Save the DNS Records:** Once you’ve updated the name servers, save the changes.

#### **Step 4: Verify the DNS Setup**
- Once the name servers are updated in GoDaddy, any DNS query for your domain will be routed to AWS Route 53 for resolution.
- You don’t need to do anything further in Route 53 for now. The DNS configuration is set up and ready for future use, such as linking the domain to EC2 instances or other AWS resources.

### **Important Notes**
- **Cost Considerations:** 
   - **Domain Purchase:** You will pay the domain provider (e.g., GoDaddy) annually for the domain name.
   - **Route 53 Costs:** There is a $0.50 per month cost for each hosted zone in AWS Route 53.
  
- You can choose to complete this step later in your labs when you are ready to configure resources like EC2 instances and link them to your domain.

### **Conclusion**
With this setup, you now have a fully functioning domain name and DNS management system for your labs. You have:
- A domain name purchased.
- A public hosted zone set up in AWS Route 53.
- DNS routing configured to Route 53 from your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy).

This completes the DNS and domain name configuration, and you are now ready to move forward with setting up your infrastructure in AWS.

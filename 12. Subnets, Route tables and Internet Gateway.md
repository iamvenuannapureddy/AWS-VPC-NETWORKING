# **VPC Subnets, Routing, and Traffic Flow: Detailed Notes**

### 1. **Understanding VPC and Subnets**
   - **AWS Region**: Select an AWS region with multiple Availability Zones (AZs). Typically, two or more AZs are available.
   - **VPC Creation**: Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and associate it with a CIDR range (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
   - **Implicit Local Router**: Every VPC comes with a default local router for internal traffic routing. This is automatically provisioned and cannot be configured manually.

### 2. **Subnets within a VPC**
   - Subnets are created within the VPC, and each is associated with a specific AZ.
   - Subnets can be in different or the same AZs.
   - When EC2 instances are launched in subnets, they are assigned private IP addresses from the corresponding subnet CIDR range.

### 3. **Traffic Flow Between Subnets**
   - **Main Route Table**:
     - Each VPC has a default route table (main route table).
     - The main route table includes a default route for the VPC CIDR range with a target set to the local router.
   - **Routing Within VPC**:
     - If EC2 instance A (e.g., 10.1.0.15) in subnet A needs to communicate with instance B (e.g., 10.10.1.11) in subnet B, the traffic follows the main route table.
     - Since the destination (instance B) falls within the VPC CIDR range, the traffic is routed via the local router.

### 4. **Traffic Flow to the Internet**
   - **Without Internet Gateway (IGW)**:
     - If an instance attempts to communicate with the internet, the traffic is dropped as the VPC is not connected to the internet.
   - **With IGW and Updated Route Table**:
     - Attach an Internet Gateway to the VPC.
     - Add a route in the main route table for all internet traffic (0.0.0.0/0) with the target as the Internet Gateway.
   - **Public IP Requirement**:
     - Instances require a public IP to communicate directly with the internet.
     - **Conditions for Internet Connectivity**:
       1. Internet Gateway must be attached to the VPC.
       2. The route table must include a route for internet traffic via the IGW.
       3. The instance must have a public IP.

### 5. **Public and Private Subnets**
   - **Public Subnets**:
     - A subnet is public if its route table has a route for 0.0.0.0/0 via the IGW.
     - Instances in public subnets can communicate directly with the internet.
   - **Private Subnets**:
     - A subnet is private if its route table does not include a route for 0.0.0.0/0 via the IGW.
     - Instances in private subnets cannot communicate directly with the internet.
   - **Use Cases**:
     - Public subnets are typically used for web servers.
     - Private subnets are used for databases or application servers.

### 6. **Custom Route Tables**
   - Subnets can be associated with specific route tables to define their routing behavior.
   - **Scenario**:
     - Instance A in subnet A (web server) needs internet access.
     - Instance B in subnet B (database server) does not require internet access.
   - **Solution**:
     1. Create a custom route table for subnet A with a route for 0.0.0.0/0 via the IGW.
     2. Associate this custom route table with subnet A.
     3. Subnet A follows the custom route table and stops following the main route table.
     4. Subnet B continues to follow the main route table or can have its own custom route table with only a local route (no internet access).

### 7. **Key Points About Route Tables**
   - **Main Route Table**:
     - Works at the VPC level.
     - By default, all subnets follow the main route table.
     - The main route table can be modified to include additional routes (e.g., IGW routes).
   - **Custom Route Tables**:
     - Subnets stop following the main route table once associated with a custom route table.
     - Custom route tables allow granular control of traffic for specific subnets.
   - **Local Route**:
     - Every route table includes an immutable local route for intra-VPC traffic.

### 8. **Reserved IP Addresses in Subnets**
   - AWS reserves 5 IP addresses in each subnet:
     1. **Network Address**: The first IP in the subnet.
     2. **AWS Reserved**: The second IP (e.g., .1).
     3. **DNS Queries**: The third IP (e.g., .2).
     4. **Future Use**: The fourth IP (e.g., .3).
     5. **Broadcast Address**: The last IP in the subnet (not used in VPC as it doesn’t support broadcasting).
   - **Usable IPs**:
     - Subnet with /24 prefix: 251 usable IPs (out of 256).
     - Subnet with /28 prefix: 11 usable IPs (out of 16).

### 9. **AWS Console Example**
   - **Viewing Main Route Table**:
     1. Navigate to the VPC section in the AWS Console.
     2. Select the VPC (e.g., Demo VPC).
     3. Go to the Route Tables tab.
     4. Identify the main route table (marked as “Yes” under the main route table column).
     5. Check the default local route under the Routes tab.
   - **Subnet Associations**:
     - Subnets are automatically associated with the main route table unless explicitly associated with a custom route table.
     - View subnet-specific route tables under the Subnet Associations tab.

### 10. **Summary**
   - Routing in a VPC is managed through route tables.
   - Main route tables apply to all subnets by default.
   - Custom route tables allow subnet-specific routing.
   - Internet access requires an IGW, a route for 0.0.0.0/0, and a public IP for the instance.
   - Reserved IPs reduce the total usable IPs in a subnet.
   - Public subnets enable direct internet access, while private subnets are isolated from the internet.

This step-by-step understanding forms the foundation for managing VPCs, subnets, and routing in AWS.
